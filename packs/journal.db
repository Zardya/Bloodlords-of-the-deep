The cloud of mist that shrouds the isles is a constant one – no matter the season, no matter the weather, the mist remains. Unless characters are indoors, everything more than 20 ft. away from them is treated as lightly obscured, and everything more than 60 ft. away is heavily obscured.

Ancient moss-coated stones stand throughout the Isles of Thess, placed there centuries ago for purposes unknown to its modern inhabitants.

As you approach, it becomes clear that it is a large, moss-draped stone, its surface adorned with faded, spiraling carvings – the largest among them depicting the face of a grim, three-eyed man and beard made of twisting, octopi-like tentacles. Atop the stone, a plank of wood is attached to it by old, damp rope, and upon its end hangs a broken lantern…”</p></blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><strong>The Deep Mist.</strong></span> In certain areas of the isles, the mist is particularly dense, and brings with it new dangers. In these regions, everything more than 30 ft. away is considered heavily obscured. In addition, there is a constant sense of unease that makes it impossible to get comfortable – long rests cannot be attempted in these areas.</p><p>Finally, the mist here plays strange tricks on the minds of travellers, often leading them astray. Characters that travel through the deep mists for more than an hour find their sense of space and time slipping, their companions often seeming further away or closer than they really are, and see entrancing lights that hover in the distance.</p><p>When characters travel this way, those with the three lowest passive perception scores must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) save or be led away from the rest of the group. Characters searching for them must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom (Survival) check. Lost characters must make three successive Wisdom (Perception) checks against a DC of 16, 17, and 18. Should they fail all three, the lights lead them over the edge of a steep, rocky cliff roughly 150 ft. high.

Cress is home to just under a hundred human villagers, most of them either fishermen or shepherds by trade. A stout, beady-eyed blacksmith by the name of Tarl lives on the edge of town, but there are few quality materials to work with on the isles and the village has little to offer adventurers as experienced as the characters.

A type of rare seaweed with potent phosphorescent properties, moonweed – once treated with a precious sap – is used to light the Thessidines’ lanterns, giving them their distinctive, pale glow.

The furry, verdant green moss that grows upon or around the standing stones that litter the isles can have strange curative properties, and is used by islanders to keep the worst of the Waning at bay.

The fact that very few travellers ever arrive on Thess anymore, and usually come as lone, washed-up survivors, reinforces this notion. Villagers in Cress are adamant that only the dead reach the isles, and there is no escaping the mist.

Near the centre of town, a hundred or so feet from the Standing Stone, is a freehouse called the Mariner’s Rest. A tall, longhouse style dwelling topped with the characteristic loam rooftops of most structures on the isles, the Mariner’s Rest is by far the largest building in Cress. It generally serves as a communal eatery, as well as an occasional resting stop for fishermen from the other isles.</span></p><blockquote style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;margin:0.5em 0px 0.5em 10px;padding:0px 0px 0px 20px;border-left:3px solid var(--color-border-light-tertiary);font-style:italic;color:rgb(25, 24, 19);font-family:Signika, sans-serif;font-size:12.25px;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;orphans:2;text-align:start;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-color:initial\"><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;margin:0.5em 0px;min-height:1rem\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><em>Read out: “Shadows sway and shudder across the high, arched wooden ceiling of the freehouse.

They must unravel the secrets of the isles and face the shadows that lurk in the mists if they are to defeat the <strong>Bloodlords of the Deep</strong>.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Plug-in Adventure</strong></h2><p>This module is a 5e adventure designed for a party of five level 10 characters, built to be plugged easily into an existing campaign or as a short stand-alone adventure.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Background</strong></h2><p>Long ago, when gods walked the earth, the goddess Thess dwelled in the mortal realm, ruling over her chosen followers from her island dominion. As the time of the gods waned and the world was to be passed into mortal hands, Thess looked out upon her faithful, and refused to abandon them. Choosing to be inextricably bound to the world, she stayed behind as one by one the other gods departed, consigning herself to a slow diminishing.</p><p>Many centuries later, a visitor from the stars arrived on Thess’ isles. An ancient eldritch being known only as the Elder One crash-landed upon the isles. Weakened by its fall, it sought to devour the isles’ inhabitants to replenish its power and resume its astral journey. With her powers now almost faded entirely, Thess sacrificed her own physical form to seal the monstrosity away in a prison of gleaming coral, and entrusted the last of her power to her half-mortal descendants.</p><p>As time turned and legend passed into myth, the Elder One began to stir in its prison. Reaching out with its loathsome mind, it found a desperate soul that it could manipulate – a priestess of Thess called Sarenya, who was gradually succumbing to a wasting disease. Determined to save herself, she followed its voice down into the depths of the isles and drank the blood that oozed from its prison, becoming a horrendous, aberrant thing, neither living nor dead – a vampiric monster bound to the Elder One’s will. Using the power bestowed upon her by the Elder One, she subverted the priesthood of the isles from within, turning her favoured servants into vampiric monsters like herself, and has ruled the isles from the shadows since.</p><p>She awaits the day when Thess’ last descendants regain enough of the goddess’ power that they can be sacrificed to her dread master and restore its full strength…</p><p></p><h2><strong>Adventure Overview</strong></h2><p></p><p>Part I - The Voyage (Combat, Seafaring). The characters navigate the high seas on the way to the Isles of Thess and are ambushed by vampiric monsters.</p><p>Part II - Into the Mist (Combat, Exploration, Mystery). The characters must explore the mists of Thess in search of the Fairy Queen’s missing captain.</p><p>Part III - The Elder One (Boss Battle, Exploration). The characters must delve beneath the island to face off against Lady Sarenya and her dark master.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Credits</strong></h2><p><strong>Head of Content &amp; Editor</strong> - Nadav Brand</p><p><strong>Head Writer</strong> - Daniel Smith</p><p><strong>3D Sculptor</strong> - David Pereira</p><p><strong>Graphic Design</strong> - Callum Dare</p><p><strong>Maps</strong> - In collaboration with Elysium Cartography, GoAdventureMaps, &amp; Meditating Munky Maps</p><p><strong>Content Consultant</strong> - Rob Leonard</p><p><strong>Playtesters</strong> - Lukas Edelmann, Aarushi Menon, James Sutton, Jesse Carse, rAzimovTW, MisterChau.</p><p></p><p><strong>Thank you to all our Patreons &amp; Tribers!</strong></p><p></p><p>For more adventures visit mammothfactorygames.com</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1665867245328,"modifiedTime":1665976468878,"lastModifiedBy":"cP1aqbcSMQN2jq1L"},"_id":"y7OppMi1yxXETRo3","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"cP1aqbcSMQN2jq1L":3}}
